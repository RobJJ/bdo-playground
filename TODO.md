on initial load of the APP. Do some 'larger calculations that you can use later when navigating around the site.
For example:

- A country, regional, provincial average for scores each year

**MAP VISUAL**
Map on landing page will show the total scores as a range of colors, depending on their values. You should be able to view each score as a different version of the map.

Also be able to filter these scores by year
Filters: Year & 5 toggles

Python data calculation
To create a file and run the code provided, you can follow these steps:

Open a text editor or code editor on your computer.
Copy and paste the code into the editor.
Save the file with a name of your choosing and a .py extension (e.g. correlation_coefficient.py).
Open a terminal window on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the cd command. For example, if you saved the file in the documents directory, you would run the command cd documents to navigate to that directory.
Run the Python file by typing python followed by the name of the file, and press Enter. For example, if you saved the file as correlation_coefficient.py, you would run the command python correlation_coefficient.py.
This will run the code in the file and print the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value for the economic scores and the deforestation impact scores to the terminal. The Pearson correlation coefficient will be a value between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a strong positive correlation. The p-value will be a measure of the statistical significance of the correlation, with a lower p-value indicating a more significant correlation.
